Output:\nThe main difference between slow pitch softball and fastpitch softball is the pitching style and the pace of the game. Slow pitch softball is commonly played recreationally and is pitched with a slower, arcing pitch, while fastpitch softball is a Summer Olympic sport and is pitched with a faster, more powerful pitch. Additionally, the pitching distance varies between the two styles, with slow pitch being closer to home plate (35-43 feet) and fastpitch being further away (40-46 feet).<|endoftext|>"}
