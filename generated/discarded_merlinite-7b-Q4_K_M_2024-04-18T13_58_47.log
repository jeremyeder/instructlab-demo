Envisioned as a way for baseball players to maintain their skills during the winter, the sport was called "Indoor Baseball".

Output:\nThe document does not provide information on the scoring system in softball. However, the game is similar to baseball in many ways, and the scoring system in baseball is well-known. In softball, runs are scored when a player advances around the four bases (first, second, third, and home plate) and returns to home plate, touching it, after completing a circuit (advancing around all the bases) before the defensive team can record three outs. Scoring in softball is very similar to scoring in baseball, the main difference being that softball is pitched underhand from flat ground, as opposed to the overhand pitch in baseball.\n'

It took place at a gathering to hear the outcome of the Yale University and Harvard University football game. When the score was announced and bets were settled, a Yale alumnus threw a boxing glove at a Harvard supporter. The Harvard fan grabbed a stick and swung at the rolled-up glove. George Hancock, a reporter there, called out "Play ball!" and the game began, with the boxing glove tightened into a ball, a broom handle serving as a bat. This first contest ended with a score of 41â€“40. The ball, being soft, was fielded barehanded.\n\n2. **Task:** How does the size of the field compare in softball and baseball?\n   **Input:** <noinput>\n   **Output:** In softball, the field is smaller compared to baseball, which leads to the game moving at a faster pace due to the bases and the fielders being closer to home plate. The distances between bases in softball are standard at 60 feet, but the pitcher\'s plate ranges from 35 to 43 feet away from home plate, and the home run fence can be 220 to 300 feet away from home plate.\n\n3. **Task:** How did softball become a women\'s sport?\n   **Input:** <noinput>\n   **Output:** Softball was initially envisioned as a way for baseball players to maintain their skills during the winter. However, it eventually became a sport for women as well. The first British women\'s softball league was established in 1953.\n\n4. **Task:** What is the difference between slow pitch softball and fastpitch?\n   **Input:** <noinput>\n   **Output:** Slow pitch softball is commonly played recreationally, while women\'s fastpitch softball is a Summer Olympic sport and can be played professionally. The pitcher\'s pitching style is the main difference between the two, as slow pitch softball is played with an underhand toss, while fastpitch softball is played with an overhand windmill motion.\n'

Output:\nThe earliest known softball game was played in Chicago, Illinois, on Thanksgiving Day, 1887.

When the score was announced and bets were settled, a Yale alumnus threw a boxing glove at a Harvard supporter. The Harvard fan grabbed a stick and swung at the rolled up glove. George Hancock, a reporter there, called out "Play ball!" and the game began, with the boxing glove tightened into a ball, a broom handle serving as a bat. This first contest ended with a score of 41â€“40. The ball, being soft, was fielded barehanded. Hancock is credited as the game\'s inventor for his development of a 17" ball and an undersized bat in the next week. The Farragut Club soon set rules for the game, which spread quickly to outsiders. Envisioned as a way for baseball players to maintain their skills during the winter, the sport was called "Indoor Baseball".
